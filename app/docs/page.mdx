# Introduction

SkinsRestorer is a plugin that restores skins for offline mode servers & networks that gives the players the ability to
change their skins by typing a single command. In addition, SkinsRestorer allows caching skins on larger networks.

## Why should I use SkinsRestorer?

SkinsRestorer is the leading project in restoring and setting skins for Minecraft servers configured both online and
offline mode.

Role-play servers, large networks, and even small video recording servers use SkinsRestorer.

You don't need a permission plugin to control commands for your players, with SkinsRestorer's plug-n-play philosophy.

### Special features

So, what is it in for you?

* Custom skins!, generate a skin for yourself (`/skin url "<url>"`) or for the entire server (`/sr createcustom`)!
* Skins will always work, even if you have no internet or when Mojang is down!
* You can get rid of Steve & Alex skins by changing them to your own default skins.
* Instant skin change (no rejoin required)

### What else can you do?

When using a 3rd party add-on such as [SkinSystem](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinSystem), you can now upload
custom `.png` skins via a web interface, by utilizing the awesome [MineSkin](https://mineskin.org) API!
