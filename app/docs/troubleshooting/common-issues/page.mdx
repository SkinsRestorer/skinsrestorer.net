# Common issues

We've compiled a list of common issues that users encounter when using the plugin.

## Host-specific issues

Your Minecraft host may be causing issues with the plugin.

### Servers with a forced proxy (like MineHut)

If your using a hosting provider that forces you to connect though a proxy you do not manage, it might not be possible to use SkinsRestorer.

You cannot really fix this because some hosting providers (like MineHuts) proxy's manages skins and capes, and you cannot change it.

### Servers with a misconfigured firewall

Sometimes your Minecraft host may have a firewall that blocks the plugin from connecting to the SkinsRestorer APIs.
If you're having issues with the plugin connecting to the API, please check our [firewall guide](/docs/troubleshooting/firewall).
