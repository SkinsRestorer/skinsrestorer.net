# Firewall

If, by running `/sr status` you get the following red message:

`> Plugin currently can't fetch new skins. You might check out our Discord at ...`

Then this means your server cannot connect to the APIs the plugin requires to work.

## How to fix it?

This is a good question, and you are the right place to get an answer.
Our plugin needs the following domains at the following ports to be fully reachable:

> All the required rules are **outgoing**, the only incoming traffic that should be accepted is the one from already
> established connections. Your server must be able to connect to the other networks. SkinsRestorer doesn't** require
> any incoming traffic from new connections to be accepted.

| Domain                          | Port  |
|---------------------------------|-------|
| `eclipse.skinsrestorer.net`     | `443` |
| `cool-skins.skinsrestorer.net`  | `443` |
| `api.mojang.com`                | `443` |
| `sessionserver.mojang.com`      | `443` |
| `api.mineskin.org`              | `443` |
| `bytebin.lucko.me`              | `443` |
| `github.com`                    | `443` |
| `api.github.com`                | `443` |
| `objects.githubusercontent.com` | `443` |

If you are using a firewall, you need to open these ports on those domains to allow the plugin to connect to these APIs.
You also need to make sure that the port `53` of your DNS server you are using is reachable and working.

## How to ask your hosting provider for this?

When you only have access to a panel like Multicraft, Pterodactyl or Pelican, you aren't able to change firewall settings yourself.
Use the below template to create a ticket / send an E-Mail to your Minecraft hosting provider and ask them to open the required ports.

Title: Firewall issues

Dear Mc-Service provider,

I believe that your firewall setup is restricting one of my plugins to work properly, namely, SkinsRestorer.
In order to allow it to function properly, I need to be able to open new outgoing connections to specific HTTP REST API services.
You can see the list of required traffic at: https://skinsrestorer.net/docs/troubleshooting/firewall

I kindly request that you permit such traffic for all Minecraft hosting services associated with my account.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact SkinsRestorer's team via:
Discord - https://skinsrestorer.net/discord
Email - support@skinsrestorer.net

Kind regards
```
