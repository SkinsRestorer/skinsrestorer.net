### Why should I use SkinsRestorer?

SkinsRestorer is the leading project in restoring and setting skins for Minecraft servers configured both online and
offline mode.

Role-play servers, large networks, and even small video recording servers use SkinsRestorer.

You don't need a permission plugin to control commands for your players, with SkinRestorer's plug-n-play philosophy.

### Special features

So, what is it in for you?

* Custom skins!, generate a skin for yourself (/skin url) or for the entire server (/sr createcustom)!
* Skins will always work, even if you have no internet or when Mojang is down!
* You can get rid of Steve & Alex skins by changing them to your own default skins.
* Instant skin change (no rejoin required)

### What else can you do?

When using a 3rd party add-on such as [SkinSystem](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinSystem), you can now upload
custom `.png` skins via a web interface, by utilizing the awesome [MineSkin](https://mineskin.org) API!
