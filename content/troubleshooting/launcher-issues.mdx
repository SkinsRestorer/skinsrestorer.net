### TLauncher is dangerous (Malware)

<Callout type="error" emoji="💣">
    TLauncher is dangerous (Malware) and should not be used.
    There is a high risk of your **account being stolen or your computer being infected with malware**.

    The TLauncher brand has been acquired by a **shady company** and is no longer safe to use.
    They intentionally stole the brand name of the original TLauncher and are now using it to spread their malware.
