# Configuration Options

The plugin should be able to run without extra configuration needed,
but if you need to change the plugin behavior, you're in the right place here.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  After changing the configuration, you need to either reload the plugin with the command `/sr reload` or restart the
  server.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you run a proxy network (BungeeCord/Velocity), you need to have the exact same `config.yml` file on the proxy and
  all servers.
  If you make a change to the config on the proxy, you need to make the same change on all servers.
  Make sure to reload the plugin on the proxy and all servers after changing the configuration.
  The `/sr reload` command is only available on the proxy (Because all backend servers are in Proxy Mode),
  you'll need to restart the servers to use the new config.

## Who can change skins?

With SkinsRestorer, players can use `/skin <skin>` to change their look.
You will have to use a permissions plugin to control who can change their skin.

You can read the [commands and permissions](/docs/configuration/commands-permissions) guide to learn how to control who can change skins.

## Default skins

By default,
SkinsRestorer applies players the skin that belongs to their Minecraft account that was set via the launcher.
Some players who join your server may not own their own Minecraft account where they can set their skin.
So for those cases, SkinsRestorer will set their skin to a steve skin.

Default skins are base skins set for players who did not explicitly set a skin using `/skin <skin>`.
If a player joins the server and did set a skin using `/skin <skin>`,
SkinsRestorer will not set their skin to a default skin and instead use the skin they set.

If you want to change this behavior,
you can do so by changing the `storage.defaultSkins` configuration in the `config.yml` file.
Changing it allows you to set
what skin players will have when they join your server
and don't have a Minecraft account associated with their username.

Additionally, if you set `applyForPremium` to `true`, SkinsRestorer will apply default skins for every player,
even if they own a Minecraft account.

## Disabled skins

If you want to disable certain skins from being used on your server using `/skin <skin>`,
you can do so by changing the `commands.disabledSkins` configuration in the `config.yml` file.

This feature is useful if you want to prevent players from using, for example, explicit or inappropriate skins.

## Permissions per skin

By default, SkinsRestorer allows players to set any skin when they have access to the `/skin <skin>` command.
You can override this behavior by setting up `commands.perSkinPermissions` in the `config.yml` file.
Any skin in that list will force the player to have the permissions `skinsrestorer.skin.<name>` to use that skin.
