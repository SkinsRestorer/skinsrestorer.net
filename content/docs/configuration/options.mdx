The plugin should be able to run without extra configuration needed,
but if you need to change the plugin behavior, you're in the right place here.

  After changing the configuration, you need to either reload the plugin with
  the command `/sr reload` or restart the server.

  If you run a proxy network (BungeeCord/Velocity), you need to have the exact
  same `config.yml` file on the proxy and all servers. If you make a change to
  the config on the proxy, you need to make the same change on all servers. Make
  sure to reload the plugin on the proxy and all servers after changing the
  configuration. The `/sr reload` command is only available on the proxy
  (Because all backend servers are in Proxy Mode), you'll need to restart the
  servers to use the new config.

## Who can change skins?

With SkinsRestorer, players can use `/skin <skin>` to change their look.
You will have to use a permissions plugin to control who can change their skin.

You can read the [commands and permissions](/docs/configuration/commands-permissions) guide to learn how to control who can change skins.

## Default skins

By default,
SkinsRestorer applies players the skin that belongs to their Minecraft account that was set via the launcher.
Some players who join your server may not own their own Minecraft account where they can set their skin.
So for those cases, SkinsRestorer will set their skin to a steve skin.

Default skins are base skins set for players who did not explicitly set a skin using `/skin <skin>`.
If a player joins the server and did set a skin using `/skin <skin>`,
SkinsRestorer will not set their skin to a default skin and instead use the skin they set.

If you want to change this behavior,
you can do so by changing the `storage.defaultSkins` configuration in the `config.yml` file.
Changing it allows you to set
what skin players will have when they join your server
and don't have a Minecraft account associated with their username.

Additionally, if you set `applyForPremium` to `true`, SkinsRestorer will apply default skins for every player,
even if they own a Minecraft account.

## Disabled skins

If you want to disable certain skins from being used on your server using `/skin <skin>`,
you can do so by changing the `commands.disabledSkins` configuration in the `config.yml` file.

This feature is useful if you want to prevent players from using, for example, explicit or inappropriate skins.

## Permissions per skin

By default, SkinsRestorer allows players to set any skin when they have access to the `/skin <skin>` command.
You can override this behavior by setting up `commands.perSkinPermissions` in the `config.yml` file.
Any skin in that list will force the player to have the permissions `skinsrestorer.skin.<name>` to use that skin.

## Proxy mode settings

If you're running a proxy network (BungeeCord/Velocity), you can configure how backend servers detect and interact with the proxy.
These settings are only relevant for backend servers, not the proxy itself.

```yaml filename="config.yml"
server:
  proxyMode:
    detection: AUTO
    api: true
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `detection` | `AUTO` | How proxy mode is determined. Options: `ENABLED` (force on), `DISABLED` (force off), or `AUTO` (auto-detect) |
| `api` | `true` | Enable SkinsRestorer API on backend servers. Requires MySQL configured to the same database as the proxy |

## API settings

Configure how SkinsRestorer interacts with external APIs.

```yaml filename="config.yml"
api:
  mineSkinApiKey: ""
  mineSkinSecretSkins: false
  fetchRecommendedSkins: true
  mojangBatchWindowSeconds: 1
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `mineSkinApiKey` | (empty) | Your MineSkin API key from [mineskin.org/apikey](https://mineskin.org/apikey) to speed up skin generation requests |
| `mineSkinSecretSkins` | `false` | When enabled, skins generated via MineSkin will be hidden from their public gallery |
| `fetchRecommendedSkins` | `true` | Load curated recommended skins. Disabling this breaks `/skin random` |
| `mojangBatchWindowSeconds` | `1` | Window size in seconds for batching Mojang API requests to avoid rate limits |
