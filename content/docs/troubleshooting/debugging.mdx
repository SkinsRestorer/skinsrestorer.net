import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

When something isn't working correctly, SkinsRestorer provides several tools to help diagnose the issue.

## Debug mode

Enable debug logging to see detailed information about API requests and internal operations.

```yaml filename="config.yml"
dev:
  debug: true
```

After enabling, restart or reload the plugin:
```
/sr reload
```

Debug mode will log:
- All API requests to Mojang/MineSkin/SkinsRestorer endpoints
- Skin data processing steps
- Cache hits and misses
- Plugin messaging channel communication

<Callout type="warning">
  Debug mode generates a lot of log output. Only enable it temporarily while troubleshooting, then disable it.
</Callout>

## Using /sr dump

The most useful troubleshooting command is `/sr dump`:

```
/sr dump
```

This uploads the following to a paste service:
- Server and plugin version information
- Your configuration (sensitive data redacted)
- Recent relevant log entries
- Installed plugins list
- System information

You'll receive a URL like `https://bytebin.lucko.me/xxxxx` that you can share with support.

## Using /sr status

Check connectivity to required API endpoints:

```
/sr status
```

This shows the status of:
- `eclipse.skinsrestorer.net` - UUID and profile lookups
- `axolotl.skinsrestorer.net` - MineSkin URL decryption
- `cool-skins.skinsrestorer.net` - Recommended skins
- Mojang API endpoints
- MineSkin API (if configured)

If any endpoint shows as unavailable, check your [firewall configuration](/docs/troubleshooting/firewall).

## Understanding log messages

### Startup messages

**Healthy startup:**
```
[SkinsRestorer] +==================+
[SkinsRestorer] |   SkinsRestorer  |
[SkinsRestorer] |------------------|
[SkinsRestorer] |    Server Mode   |
[SkinsRestorer] +==================+
```

or for proxy networks:
```
[SkinsRestorer] |    Proxy Mode    |
```

**Warning messages:**
```
[SkinsRestorer] Proxy mode files are deprecated, please use the config file instead.
```
This means you have old `.txt` configuration files. Migrate to config.yml settings.

### Common log errors

**Connection errors:**
```
[SkinsRestorer] Failed to connect to eclipse.skinsrestorer.net
```
Check your firewall and network connectivity.

**Rate limit errors:**
```
[SkinsRestorer] Rate limited by Mojang API
```
This is normal during high traffic. SkinsRestorer will retry automatically.

**Database errors:**
```
[SkinsRestorer] Failed to connect to database
```
Check your database credentials and that MySQL is running.

| Platform | Log location |
|----------|--------------|
| Bukkit/Spigot/Paper | `logs/latest.log` |
| BungeeCord | `proxy.log.0` |
| Velocity | `logs/latest.log` |
| Fabric/NeoForge | `logs/latest.log` |

## Filtering logs for SkinsRestorer

## Common debugging scenarios

### Skin not applying

1. Enable debug mode
2. Run `/skin <playerName>`
3. Check logs for:
   - "Fetching skin data for..." - API request started
   - "Received skin data..." - Data received successfully
   - "Applying skin to..." - Application started
   - Any error messages

### Proxy mode issues

1. Check startup logs for "Proxy Mode" or "Server Mode"
2. Run `/sr status` to check connectivity
3. Verify plugin messaging channels are working

### API connectivity issues

1. Run `/sr status`
2. If endpoints fail, check:
   - Firewall rules
   - DNS resolution
   - Proxy/VPN interference

## Getting support

When asking for help:

1. Run `/sr dump` and include the link
2. Describe what you expected vs what happened
