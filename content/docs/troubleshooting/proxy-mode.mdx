description: Learn how to troubleshoot proxy mode issues with SkinsRestorer.

This page is for servers that are using a proxy (BungeeCord, Waterfall or Velocity) in their network to connect multiple servers together.
If you're not using a proxy, you can skip this page.

Using a proxy? --> You MUST use proxy installation!

## What is "Proxy Mode"?

The proxy will handle SkinsRestorer's commands, API, permission, database and config in a "centralized" manner.

## How to install on proxy?

Please read: https://skinsrestorer.net/docs/installation#platform-installation

## Proxy Mode Configuration

Proxy mode can be configured in the `config.yml` file on your backend servers:

```yaml filename="config.yml"
server:
  proxyMode:
    # Options: ENABLED, DISABLED, or AUTO (default)
    detection: AUTO
    # Enable API access on backend servers (requires database)
    api: true
```

### Proxy Mode Detection

The `detection` option controls how proxy mode is determined:

- `AUTO` (default): Automatically detects if the server is behind a proxy
- `ENABLED`: Forces proxy mode on
- `DISABLED`: Forces proxy mode off

### Backend API Access

The `api` option (default: `true`) enables plugins on backend servers to use the SkinsRestorer API.
This is useful when using plugins like BedWars, Dynmap, etc. that need to get skin data through the API from the backend server.

Keep in mind that connecting MySQL to the same database as the proxy is required for this to work!

### Disabling Proxy Mode

Disabling proxy mode will force the backend to handle everything including applying skins on join.
This is not recommended as the proxy has better control over the player connection.

To disable proxy mode, set `detection: DISABLED` in your backend server's `config.yml`.
