description: Learn about known incompatibilities with SkinsRestorer.
---

SkinsRestorer may collide with third-party software such as plugins, mods, launchers, etc.
Here we share common reasons for issues.

## Incompatible clients

Launchers that have built-in skin mods or other game-altering mods that block SkinsRestorer.
We have a [page](/docs/troubleshooting/launcher-issues) dedicated to these issues.

## General server plugin types causing issues

Some not-well-coded plugins or plugins that modify the user profile mightn't work well with SkinsRestorer.
You can see this when you, for example, change a skin, and you see the chunks reload, but your skin just won't apply.

- Other skin plugins like `MySKin`
- `Skript` (They can also hook into skins)
- Custom world plugins
- Some TabList plugins

To figure out if it is a plugin incompatibility,
the best thing to do is running your server with SkinsRestorer as the only plugin
and see if it then works.
If so, you can try adding plugins and check each time if the plugin still works.
This way you can identify the plugin that might cause the issue.

## Server plugins that need config change

- `FastLogin` -> FastLogin `config.yml` -> `forwardSkin: false{:yaml}`
- `MundoSK` -> MundoSK `config.yml` -> `usecustomskins: false{:yaml}`

## Server plugin incompatibility

Some plugins are known to cause issues with SkinsRestorer. Here is a list of known incompatible plugins:

- `AntiBotDeluxe`
- `Nicknamer`
- `OldCombatMechanics` (older versions)
- `Tablisknu`
- `WorldChangeScreenRemover`

### Server software incompatibility

We do not work on some Paper forks as well as some BungeeCord forks because they break the platforms API somehow.
We have only limited support for forge servers because they are usually breaking things as well.
Very commonly issues happen with:

- `Aegis`
- `FlameCord`
- `Magma`
- `Mohist`
- `Cardboard`

We want to support these platforms, but we can't do it alone if you are a developer and want to help us,
feel free to open a PR on our GitHub.
