SkinsRestorer uses [MineSkin](https://mineskin.org) to convert custom PNG files into valid Minecraft skins.
While MineSkin works without an API key, getting one provides significant benefits.

## Why use a MineSkin API key?

| Feature | Without API Key | With API Key |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Request limit | Low | Higher (depends on plan) |
| Request speed | Slower | Faster |
| Cape generation | No | Yes (except Lite) |
| Secret skins | No | Yes |
| Priority queue | No | Yes |

## Getting an API key

1. Visit [mineskin.org/apikey](https://mineskin.org/apikey)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Choose a plan that fits your needs
4. Generate your API key

## Configuring your API key

Add your API key to `config.yml`:

```yaml filename="config.yml"
api:
  mineSkinApiKey: "your-api-key-here"
```

Then reload the plugin:
```
/sr reload
```

## Secret skins

When `mineSkinSecretSkins` is enabled, skins you generate won't appear in MineSkin's public gallery.

```yaml filename="config.yml"
api:
  mineSkinApiKey: "your-api-key-here"
  mineSkinSecretSkins: true
```

This is useful for:
- Custom server skins you don't want shared
- Event-specific skins
- Private branding

## Rate limits and batching

SkinsRestorer includes built-in rate limit handling:

```yaml filename="config.yml"
api:
  mojangBatchWindowSeconds: 1
```

This batches Mojang API requests within a time window to avoid hitting rate limits. The default of 1 second works well for most servers.

For high-traffic servers:
- Increase the batch window to 2-3 seconds
- Consider a higher-tier MineSkin plan
- Monitor your MineSkin usage dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### "Rate limited" errors

- Your API key may have exceeded its limit
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider upgrading your MineSkin plan

### "Invalid API key" errors

- Verify the key is copied correctly
- Check that the key hasn't expired
- Regenerate the key on MineSkin's website

### Slow skin generation

- Check your MineSkin dashboard for queue status
- Higher-tier plans get priority
- Server load affects generation speed
