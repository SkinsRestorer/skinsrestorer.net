# DiscordSRV

SkinsRestorer skins can be used for DiscordSRV messages using the PlaceholderAPI integration.

## Setup instructions

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Prepare your server
    Ensure [SkinsRestorer](/docs/installation), [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/) and
    [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) are installed on your server, are the
    latest version and are working correctly.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure DiscordSRV
    Open your DiscordSRV `config.yml` and search for the `Embed & webhook image/avatar url format` section.
    The config setting looks like this:

    ```yaml filename="plugins/DiscordSRV/config.yml"
    AvatarUrl: https://crafatar.com/avatars/{uuid - nodashes}.png?size={size}&overlay#{texture}
    ```

    You have to replace it with the following:

    ```yaml filename="plugins/DiscordSRV/config.yml"
    AvatarUrl: https://mc-heads.net/avatar/%skinsrestorer_texture_id_or_steve%.png#{username}
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Reload DiscordSRV
    Run `/discord reload` to reload DiscordSRV.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### That's it!
    Now all SkinsRestorer avatars will be displayed in DiscordSRV messages! ðŸŽ‰
  </Step>
</Steps>
