Before installing, we recommend you to read the [main installation page](/docs/installation).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🆕">
  The Fabric mod build of SkinsRestorer currently targets **only the latest Minecraft release**. Running it on older
  Minecraft versions is not supported.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="🔁">
  The mod build behaves exactly like the Bukkit plugin as long as you are on a supported Minecraft version. Commands,
  configuration options, and permissions work the same way.

## Basic Installation

In this section, you can read how to set up SkinsRestorer on a Fabric (or Quilt) dedicated server.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Prepare your server
    Install the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/server/) for the latest Minecraft version on your server. If you
    already maintain a Fabric installation, make sure it is updated to the newest release.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install dependencies
    Download the matching version of [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (most Fabric servers already have
    it) and place it inside the `mods` folder of your server files.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add SkinsRestorer
    Download the latest SkinsRestorer mod file from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/skinsrestorer) and copy it into
    the same `mods` folder.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Start the server
    Start or restart your Fabric server so the new mods are loaded. Watch the console for any warnings or dependency
    messages.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Verify everything works
    Join the server and run `/skinsrestorer status`. If you previously used the Bukkit plugin, you should notice the
    same behaviour and configuration.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure SkinsRestorer
    Adjust the configuration files inside `config/SkinsRestorer/` just like you would on Bukkit. Refer to the
    [configuration guide](/docs/configuration) if you need help.
  </Step>
</Steps>
