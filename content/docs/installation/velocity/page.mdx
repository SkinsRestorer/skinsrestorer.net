    Heads up! SkinsRestorer works best when you also install it on your backend servers.

<Steps>
    ### Download the plugin
    Download the latest version from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/skinsrestorer)

    ### Put it in the Velocity folder
    Place the `SkinsRestorer.jar` in the `plugins` folder of the **Velocity proxy**.

    ### Put it into every Spigot folder
    Place the `SkinsRestorer.jar` in the `plugins` folders of **every Spigot server**.

    ### Setup player information forwarding
    You need to setup player information forwarding in order for SkinsRestorer to communicate with your backend servers.
    For that, follow the [Velocity forwarding guide](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/player-information-forwarding).
    This step is required for the plugin to work correctly on your network.
    If this step is not done correctly, the plugin will not work correctly.

    ### Restart your servers
    Restart (`/restart`, `/stop` or `/end`) all Spigot servers and the Velocity proxy.

    ### Ensure the plugin is in Proxy Mode on the servers
    In every Spigot server, check the server logs for the messages like these:
    ```ansi filename="logs/latest.log"
    [33;1m[[32;22mSkinsRestorer[33;1m] [32;22m----------------------------------------------
    [33;1m[[32;22mSkinsRestorer[33;1m] [32;22m    +==================+
    [33;1m[[32;22mSkinsRestorer[33;1m] [32;22m    |   SkinsRestorer  |
    [33;1m[[32;22mSkinsRestorer[33;1m] [32;22m    |------------------|

    ```
    The plugin has to say that it is using "Proxy Mode". If you see this message, you're good to go!

    If you don't see this message, make sure you you set up player information forwarding correctly.
    SkinsRestorer will not work correctly if you don't see this message.

    ### Configure the plugin
    You may now [configure SkinsRestorer](/docs/configuration) on the Velocity proxy.

    ### Sync configs
    Make sure you have the same `plugins/SkinsRestorer/config.yml` file on all servers and the Velocity proxy.
    This file contains important settings that are required for the plugin to work the same on all servers.
    If you don't have the same `config.yml` file on all servers, you may experience issues.

    ### Restart your servers
    Restart (`/restart`, `/stop` or `/end`) all Spigot servers and the Velocity proxy.

    ### Check console for errors
    Check the console logs of Velocity and all servers for errors
    If you see any errors, report them to us on Discord.

    ### That's it!
    Our plugin should now work on your network!
