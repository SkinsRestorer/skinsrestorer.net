## Basic Installation

In this section, you can read how to set up SkinsRestorer on a NeoForge server (including Forge forks that can load
NeoForge mods).

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install NeoForge
    Download the latest NeoForge installer from [neoforged.net](https://neoforged.net/) and follow the documentation to
    install the server for the newest Minecraft version.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Create or update the mods folder
    Run the generated `run.bat`/`run.sh` once so NeoForge creates its file structure, including the `mods` folder. Update
    your installation to the latest build if you already have a server.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add SkinsRestorer
    Download the newest SkinsRestorer mod jar from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/skinsrestorer) and place it inside
    the server's `mods` folder.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Start the server
    Launch the server and let NeoForge finish loading. Watch the console for dependency messages or errors.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Confirm the installation
    Use `/skinsrestorer status` or `/sr status` in game or in the server console. You should see the same information you
    would get on Bukkit-based servers.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure SkinsRestorer
    Edit the configuration files in `config/SkinsRestorer/` to match your needs. The configuration format is identical to
    the Bukkit edition—refer to the [configuration guide](/docs/configuration) for details.
  </Step>
</Steps>
