SkinsRestorer provides an [/upload](/upload) page that turns your skin PNG into a ready-to-use `/skin url` command.
Use it to safely upload your file to MineSkin and copy the command in just a few clicks.

## Before you start

Make sure your skin file is a valid Minecraft skin PNG (typically 64Ã—64 or 64Ã—32) and that it is saved locally on your computer.
If you do not have one yet, our [skin design guide](/docs/features/skin-design) can help you create it.

## Generate the command with /upload

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the /upload page

    Visit the [/upload](/upload) page on skinsrestorer.net.
    The page shows the uploader card with instructions and a button labelled **Generate /skin url**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Select your skin PNG

    Drag and drop the file onto the uploader card or click **Choose file** to browse for it.
    The preview updates once the file is selected so you can confirm the correct skin.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Copy the generated command

    Click **Generate /skin url**. The site uploads the PNG to MineSkin and returns a URL.
    Once the command appears, press the copy button next to it or manually copy the `/skin url "https://..."` text.

    Paste the command in game or console to apply the skin. Make sure the URL stays wrapped in quotes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- **Upload fails**: Ensure the PNG is under 3 MB and matches the standard Minecraft skin dimensions.
- **Command missing quotes**: Always keep the generated quotes to avoid issues with special characters in the URL.
- **Need to redo the skin**: You can upload again at any time; each upload generates a fresh URL.

That's it! Using the /upload page you no longer need to rely on third-party hostsâ€”SkinsRestorer and MineSkin handle the heavy lifting for you.
