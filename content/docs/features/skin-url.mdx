# Skin URL

SkinsRestorer allows you to use a custom skin by using a URL.
This way you can use a skin not from another player, but from a URL.

## Confirm a valid skin

Make sure the URL points to only the valid skin PNG file.
If you are using imgur, make sure that the url ends with `.png`.
A valid skin url should look like this: https://i.imgur.com/QuoWt6B.png

You can see the image below as reference:

## Uploading to imgur

This time we are going to upload your custom skin format to imgur. Follow the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Download the file

    You need to get a skin file in `.png` format. You can use the skin you created or downloaded from the internet.
    We have a [skin design](/docs/features/skin-design) guide if you need help with that.

    <Step>
    ### Go to https://imgur.com/upload

    Upload the file to **imgur** (see image below)

    </Step>

      <Step>
    ### Getting the URL

    The Skin URL **__must__** end with `.png`, so make sure that you have the right URL!

    Below you can see the skin I just uploaded to imgur, now right-click on the image and hit "Copy image address"

    It should copy an URL like `https://i.imgur.com/abcdefgh.png`

    ![Copy link from uploaded image](/assets/imgur/copy-link.png)

    That's it! You can now set the skin by using your **imgur** URL!
    The command to set the skin is `/skin url "<url>"`.
    Make sure the URL is in quotes.
      </Step>
