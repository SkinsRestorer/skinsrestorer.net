SkinsRestorer preserves capes when applying skins from Mojang players.

## How capes work

Capes are part of Mojang's skin data system. When you apply a skin from a player who has a cape (like Minecon attendees), the cape is included in the skin data.

### Cape sources

Capes can come from:
- **Minecon capes**: Given to Minecon/Minecraft Live attendees
- **Migrator cape**: Given to players who migrated from Mojang to Microsoft accounts
- **Vanilla cape**: Given to Bedrock Edition players linked to Java Edition
- **Realms capes**: Special capes for Realms map creators
- **Mojang capes**: Given to Mojang employees

### How SkinsRestorer handles capes

When you use `/skin <playerName>`:

1. SkinsRestorer fetches the player's complete skin data from Mojang
2. This data includes both the skin texture AND any cape the player has
3. When applied, you'll have both their skin and their cape

<Callout type="info">
  You cannot get banned for using someone else's cape through SkinsRestorer. The skin system uses the original player's signed data, so Mojang sees it as that player's skin being displayed.
</Callout>

## Finding players with capes

To use a skin with a cape, you need to know the username of a player who has one.

Some well-known players with capes:
- `Dinnerbone` (Mojang employee cape)
- `Notch` (Founder cape)

<Callout type="warning">
  Player capes can change if the original player removes their cape or changes accounts. The cape you see depends on what the original player currently has equipped.
</Callout>

## Custom capes via MineSkin

MineSkin (used for `/skin url` commands) supports cape generation on paid plans.

When generating a skin through MineSkin with a cape:
1. The cape must be a separate PNG file
2. Cape dimensions should be 64x32 pixels
3. The cape is applied through MineSkin's account pool

<Callout type="info">
  Cape generation requires a MineSkin API key on plans other than Lite. See our [MineSkin Integration guide](/docs/integrations/mineskin) for setup.
</Callout>

## Limitations

### What SkinsRestorer cannot do

- **Create custom capes from scratch**: Capes require Mojang's signature, so you can't create arbitrary capes
- **Remove capes from skins**: If a player's skin includes a cape, you'll get both
- **Apply capes to URL skins**: URL skins only have skin data, not capes (unless using MineSkin's cape feature)

### Cape visibility

Capes are visible to all players on the server, just like regular Minecraft capes. They're part of the skin data packet sent to clients.

## Troubleshooting

### Cape not showing

1. Verify the original player actually has a cape equipped
2. Use `/sr info player <playerName>` to check the skin data
3. Some players toggle capes on/off in their Minecraft settings

### Wrong cape displayed

The cape displayed depends on what the original player currently has equipped. If they changed their cape, the cached data in SkinsRestorer may be outdated.

To refresh:
```
/skin update
```

Or clear the cache:
```
/sr drop skin <skinName>
```
