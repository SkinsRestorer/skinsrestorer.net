    ### Getting the URL

    The Skin URL **__must__** end with `.png`, so make sure that you have the right URL!

    Below you can see the skin I just uploaded to imgur, now right-click on the image and hit "Copy image address"

    It should copy an URL like `https://i.imgur.com/abcdefgh.png`

    ![Copy link from uploaded image](/assets/imgur/copy-link.png)

    That's it! You can now set the skin by using your **imgur** URL!
    The command to set the skin is `/skin url "url"`.
    Make sure the URL is in quotes.
