# Custom Skins

SkinsRestorer allows you to create custom skins that you can select via `/skin <name>`.
All You have to do is either run a command to generate a skin or upload a skin file to the server.

## How to generate a custom skin

Before you start, there are a few things to consider. Custom skins are stored in the SkinsRestorer database or in a file.
The name affects everyone who runs the `/skin` command, so if an admin generates a custom skin called `Dinnerbone`
everyone who runs `/skin Dinnerbone` will see the custom skin instead of the original skin.

You would also not want to use a name that a person playing on your server might use,
as it would override their skin instead of using the skin they have set in their Minecraft account.

    If you want to set a skin of a player on your server, run `/skin [name] [playername]` instead.
    Using custom skins to set a skin of a player is not recommended and discouraged.

There are multiple ways to generate a custom skin:

### Run a command

Run `/sr createcustom <name> <url> <variant>` to generate a custom skin by URL.

### Skinfile Generator

We have built a web app that allows you to convert .png skin files to .customskin files that are used by SkinsRestorer.
You can find the Skinfile Generator on [our website](/generator).

    The Skinfile Generator only works if you use file storage. MySQL users should use the `/sr createcustom` command.
</Callout>

Steps to generate a custom skin using the Skinfile Generator:

1. Get your skin file in .png format
2. Go to [the website](/generator)
3. Hit browse and select your skin
4. Fill in the skin name in the optional skin name field (Make sure it is lowercase and does not contain a space)
5. Hit `Upload!`
6. Download the `name.customskin` file
7. Upload or replace it on your `plugins/SkinsRestorer/skins` folder
8. If you do not have Velocity/BungeeCord, put it in your Spigot
9. Done! You should now be able to do `/skin <name>` and it will appear!

## Apply custom default skins

If you want to apply a default skin for your server, you can do the following:

1. Generate a custom skin using the methods above.
2. Add the file into your skin file directory of either your proxy or your spigot server.
3. Enable default skins in the config.
4. Reload SkinsRestorer via `/sr reload`.
5. Done! Every player that joins your server will now have the default skin you set unless they have set a skin with SkinsRestorer before.
