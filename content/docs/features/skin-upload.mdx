SkinsRestorer provides multiple ways to upload and apply custom skin PNG files.

## In-game command

Running `/skin upload` in-game will display information about how to upload skins.
This command requires the `skinsrestorer.command.set.url` permission.

The command directs you to use one of the upload methods below.

## Upload methods

### Method 1: Website upload page (Recommended)

The easiest way to upload a skin is using the [/upload](/upload) page on skinsrestorer.net.

1. Visit [skinsrestorer.net/upload](/upload)
2. Select your skin PNG file
3. Click "Generate /skin url"
4. Copy the generated command
5. Paste it in-game

See the [Skin URL Upload guide](/docs/features/skin-url) for detailed instructions.

### Method 2: Direct URL command

If your skin is already hosted online, use `/skin url` directly:

```
/skin url "https://example.com/myskin.png"
```

For slim (Alex-style) skins, add the variant:

```
/skin url "https://example.com/myskin.png" slim
```

<Callout type="info">
  The URL must point directly to a PNG file and be publicly accessible. The URL should be wrapped in quotes.
</Callout>

## Skin variants

When uploading skins, you can specify the arm model:

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `classic` | Standard Steve-style arms (4 pixels wide) |
| `slim` | Alex-style arms (3 pixels wide) |

If you don't specify a variant, SkinsRestorer will attempt to auto-detect it based on the skin file.

## Supported formats

- **Dimensions**: 64x64 pixels (modern) or 64x32 pixels (legacy)
- **Format**: PNG only
- **File size**: Under 3 MB
- **Transparency**: Supported for overlay layers

## How it works

When you upload a skin via URL:

1. SkinsRestorer sends the URL to [MineSkin](https://mineskin.org)
2. MineSkin applies the skin to a Minecraft account from their pool
3. MineSkin returns the signed skin data from Mojang
4. SkinsRestorer applies this data to your player

This process ensures your skin has a valid Mojang signature, which is required for the Minecraft client to display it.

## URL restrictions

Server administrators can restrict which URLs are allowed for skin uploads.

If `commands.restrictSkinUrls.enabled` is set to `true` in the config, only URLs from whitelisted domains will be accepted.

Default allowed domains:
- `https://i.imgur.com`
- `https://storage.googleapis.com`
- `https://cdn.discordapp.com`
- `https://textures.minecraft.net`

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid URL" error
- Ensure the URL points directly to a PNG file
- Check that the URL is publicly accessible
- Wrap the URL in quotes if it contains special characters

### "Rate limited" error
- MineSkin has rate limits for skin generation
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider getting a MineSkin API key for higher limits

### Skin not applying correctly
- Verify your PNG is 64x64 or 64x32 pixels
- Check if you need to specify `slim` for Alex-style skins
- Ensure the file is a valid PNG (not renamed JPG)
