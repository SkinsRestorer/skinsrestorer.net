# PlaceholderAPI

SkinsRestorer supports PlaceholderAPI placeholders. These placeholders are automatically registered with
PlaceholderAPI when both SkinsRestorer and PlaceholderAPI are installed on the server.

## SkinsRestorer Placeholders

Here is a list of all possible placeholders. If a database error occurs, the placeholder will be replaced with
`Error` and an error message will be logged to the console.

## What is a texture id and url?

A texture id is a unique identifier for a skin on the Minecraft Content Delivery Network (CDN). It is used by the
Minecraft client to download the skin from the CDN. The texture url is the url to the skin on the CDN.

For example, the texture url of the steve skin is, `https://textures.minecraft.net/texture/6d3b06c38504ffc0229b9492147c69fcf59fd2ed7885f78502152f77b4d50de1`
and the texture id therefore is `6d3b06c38504ffc0229b9492147c69fcf59fd2ed7885f78502152f77b4d50de1`.
